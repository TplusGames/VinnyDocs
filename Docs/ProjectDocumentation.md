## UI

The UI section explains how our widgets, controllers, and HUD work together in **Vinny and Glitch**.

- **[VinnyUserWidget](VinnyUserWidgetDoc.md)**
  > The visual screen widget that can fade in/out and listens to a controller.

- **[WidgetController](WidgetControllerDoc.md)**
  > The “brain” that sends messages to widgets, telling them what to do.

- **[VinnyHUD](VinnyHUDDoc.md)**
  > The stage manager that creates widgets and controllers, and sets up the UI for the player.


> Tip: All UI documentation is written in **simple, step-by-step language** with examples, so anyone on the team can follow along.
